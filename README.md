## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the AI Website Generator up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   A Google Cloud Project with the Gemini API enabled.
*   An API Key for the Google Gemini API.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd ai-website-generator
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure Google Gemini API Key

The application expects the Gemini API key to be available via `process.env.API_KEY`.
You need to set this environment variable before running the application.

**Local Development (Example with `dotenv` or direct export):**

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2.  Add your API key to this file:
    ```
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    *(Note: For Applets environments, `process.env.API_KEY` is automatically provided. This step is mainly for local testing and development outside the Applets environment if you were to run it as a standard Angular app.)*

Alternatively, you can export it directly in your terminal (for the current session):
```bash
export API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
```
Or, when running the `npm start` command:
```bash
API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" npm start
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will compile and launch the application. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` (or the port specified in your terminal).

2.  **Input Your Vision:** Provide a clear website idea or description.
3.  **Click "Generate Website":** The AI will process your inputs and generate a comprehensive website outline and content suggestions, optionally using Google Search or returning JSON.
4.  **Preview and Refine:** The generated content will appear in the preview pane on the right. You can download the generated HTML or JSON, and review any Google Search sources. Refine your inputs in the form and regenerate to iterate on the design and content.
