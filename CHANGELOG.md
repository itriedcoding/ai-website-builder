### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactorings & Improvements

*   **App Component Refactor:** `AppComponent` is now solely a layout shell, managing global elements and the `router-outlet`.
*   **Centralized AI Logic:** All AI generation-related state and methods have been moved from `AppComponent` to `HomeComponent` for better modularity.
*   **Aesthetic Design Overhaul:**
    *   Refined color scheme emphasizing white, subtle blues, and crisp typography for a modern, professional, and inviting look.
    *   Improved spacing, shadows, and border radii for all interactive elements and sections.
    *   Enhanced hover states and transitions across buttons, links, and form fields.
    *   Updated input fields, select boxes, and text areas with consistent `rounded-lg`, `shadow-sm`, and `focus:ring-blue-500` styles.
    *   Visually appealing range sliders for AI configuration parameters.
    *   Sections within the `GeneratorFormComponent` are more clearly delineated with `bg-blue-50/20` backgrounds and prominent headings.
*   **Improved Gemini Service API:** `GeminiService` now accepts a more flexible `GenerateContentParameters` object, allowing direct control over `config` and `tools`, and returns the full `GenerateContentResponse`.
*   **Structured Output Handling:** `WebsitePreviewComponent` now accepts a structured `GeneratedWebsiteOutput` object, enabling display of HTML, JSON, and grounding URLs.
*   **Conditional Field Disabling:** Added logic to disable JSON output options when Google Search Grounding is enabled, respecting API limitations.
*   **`new Date()` in Template Fixed:** Replaced direct `new Date().getFullYear()` in `app.component.html` with a computed signal in `AppComponent` for better practice. Similarly for legal pages.
*   **Enhanced Error Messages:** Improved clarity of error messages during AI generation.
*   **Updated README.md:** Reflected all new pages, features, and usage instructions.
*   **Form Validation:** Implemented `minMaxValidator` for numerical range inputs and a conditional `jsonSchemaValidator` for JSON output description.
*   **Form Organization:** Grouped related advanced features into new, distinct sections within the generator form for improved user experience.
*   **Accessibility:** Continued focus on semantic HTML and clear labels.
