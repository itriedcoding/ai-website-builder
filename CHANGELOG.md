### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactorings & Improvements

*   **Centralized AI Configuration:** Consolidated AI generation parameters from `AppComponent` into a structured object passed to `GeminiService`.

*   **Structured Output Handling:** `AppComponent` now processes the full `GenerateContentResponse` from `GeminiService` to extract text, grounding URLs, and determine output type.
*   **Dynamic Preview Update:** `WebsitePreviewComponent` now accepts a structured `GeneratedWebsiteOutput` object, enabling display of HTML, JSON, and grounding URLs.
*   **Conditional Field Disabling:** Added logic to disable JSON output options when Google Search Grounding is enabled, respecting API limitations.
*   **`new Date()` in Template Fixed:** Replaced direct `new Date().getFullYear()` in `app.component.html` with a computed signal in `AppComponent` for better practice.
*   **Enhanced Error Messages:** Improved clarity of error messages during AI generation.
*   **Updated README.md:** Reflected all new features and usage instructions.
*   **Form Validation:** Implemented `minMaxValidator` for numerical range inputs and a conditional `jsonSchemaValidator` for JSON output description.
