      <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information Neura AI collects, how that information is used, and your options regarding your data.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-400 mb-3 mt-6">1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-medium text-teal-400 mb-2 mt-4">1.1. User Input:</h3>
      <p>When you use our Neura AI, you provide text prompts, preferences (colors, layout, features), and other data to guide the AI in generating content. This input is processed by the underlying AI model (Google Gemini) to fulfill your request. We do not store your specific prompts or generated outputs on our servers after the session concludes.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-medium text-teal-400 mb-2 mt-4">1.2. API Key:</h3>
      <p>The application uses an API key (`process.env.API_KEY`) to interact with the Google Gemini API. This key is expected to be provided externally and is not collected or stored by the application itself.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-medium text-teal-400 mb-2 mt-4">1.3. Usage Data:</h3>
      <p>We may collect anonymous usage data to understand how the application is used (e.g., component interactions, page views). This data is aggregated and does not identify individual users.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-400 mb-3 mt-6">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and improve the AI Next.js project generation service.</li>
        <li>To analyze and understand usage patterns to enhance user experience and application features.</li>
        <li>To debug and resolve technical issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-400 mb-3 mt-6">3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties. Your prompts and generated content are transmitted to the Google Gemini API solely for the purpose of generating the Next.js project content as per your request.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-400 mb-3 mt-6">4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information transmitted to and from our application. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-400 mb-3 mt-6">5. Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>Our application may contain links to third-party websites or services (e.g., Google Search grounding URLs). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-400 mb-3 mt-6">6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our application is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-400 mb-3 mt-6">7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
